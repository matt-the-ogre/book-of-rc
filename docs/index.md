# Welcome to The Book of RC

Helping people discover and thrive in the world of Remote Control (RC) vehicles.

This started as my keeping a notebook as I built my own 3D-printed RC truck. I thought it would be useful for others to follow along and learn from my experience. If you have any feedback, please contact me through a GitHub Issue in the [public repository for this book](https://github.com/matt-the-ogre/book-of-rc/).

While this site is currently focused on trucks and other land / wheeled vehicles, I plan to expand it to other vehicle types as I learn more and build more projects.
