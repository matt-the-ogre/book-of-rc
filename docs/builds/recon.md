# Recon Truck Body

To go with the Voyager_MK1 truck chassis I'm building, I have purchased the 3D printable models for the [Recon](https://gcz-creation.com/produit/the-recon/) truck body from [GCZ Creation](https://gcz-creation.com/).

> *Note:* The above image is from the creator's site, not my build.

There are three guides written to help prepare materials, print the parts, and build the Recon body.

| Guide | Description |

| [Bill of Materials (BOM)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FUgoCs5sS5PCor8hCyM7qEs9vzVH0TlOm-tsuQK22jU/edit#slide=id.g2dedf7ee755_0_103) | What to buy |

## My advice

- Don't leave reading the BOM Guide until later. When you're ordering screws and nuts for the chassis build, check the body BOM for required screws and bolts too. Much easier to add them to your big order for the chassis.
- Order the filament for the body early too. You can intersperse printing chassis and body parts as you work your way through the process.
- Join the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/987064876515079) group (ugh, I know!) for GCZ Creation. The creator is on there and they are very responsive to questions and feedback.
