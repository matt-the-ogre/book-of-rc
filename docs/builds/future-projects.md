## Explorer_MK1 and R5 Turbo

Assuming the [Voyager_MK1](./voyager-mk1.md) 4x4 chassis with the [Recon](./recon.md) truck body goes well, I'd like to build the faster [Explorer_MK1](https://gcz-creation.com/produit/explorer_mk1/) car chassis with the matching [R5 Turbo](https://gcz-creation.com/produit/r5-turbo-a-blast-from-the-past/) body next.

## Planes

I'd like to build a 3D printed RC plane too. It would be interesting to do the first version with manual control and then add autonomous control as an upgrade.

## Boats

Building an RC motor or sailboat would be great too. No specific ideas here yet. I follow the [rctestflight](https://www.youtube.com/@rctestflight) channel on YouTube and he has lots of amazing builds for both planes and boats.
