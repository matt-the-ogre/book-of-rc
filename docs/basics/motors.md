# Motors

Motors are the heart of your RC vehicle, transforming electrical energy from your battery into motion. Picking the right motor is about balancing speed, torque, and efficiency to match your driving style and terrain. Let’s break it down.

## How Motors Work

RC motors come in two main types: brushed and brushless. **Brushless motors** are more efficient, durable, and powerful, making them the go-to choice for most RC enthusiasts. They use electronic commutation instead of physical brushes, reducing wear and increasing performance. On the other hand, **brushed motors** are simpler and cheaper, suitable for budget builds or casual use.

## Key Specifications

1. **KV Rating**: This measures the revolutions per minute (RPM) per volt applied to the motor. A higher KV rating means more speed but less torque. For off-road trucks, a **KV range of 3300-3500** is ideal for balanced performance.
2. **Turns (T)**: The "turns" of a motor represent how many times the wire is wound around the stator. Lower turns (e.g., 10.5T) mean higher speed but less torque. Higher turns (e.g., 13.5T) offer more torque and smoother control, making them better for off-road driving.
3. **Size**: Most 1/10 scale vehicles use **540** or **550-sized motors**. The 550 size is slightly larger and provides more torque, which is great for rough terrain.
4. **Sensorless vs. Sensored**: Sensorless motors are simpler and more durable, while sensored motors provide smoother control at low speeds. Off-road drivers often prefer sensored motors for their precision during technical maneuvers.

## Matching Your Motor

Choosing the right motor depends on your driving goals:

- **Speed-focused builds**: Go for a lower-turn or higher-KV motor.
- **Off-road and climbing**: Opt for a higher-turn or lower-KV motor with more torque.
- **General use**: A motor in the 3300-3500KV range or 13.5T is a balanced choice.

## Good, Better, Best Recommendations
