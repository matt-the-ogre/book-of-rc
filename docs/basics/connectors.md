# Connectors

Connectors may be small, but they play a critical role in keeping your RC vehicle running smoothly. They ensure power flows reliably between the battery, ESC, and motor while also providing safe, secure connections that withstand the demands of off-road driving. Let’s break down the most common connector types, their uses, and what to look for when choosing them.

## Understanding Connector Types

### Battery to ESC Connectors

These connectors handle the high current flow between your battery and ESC. Compatibility is key here since mismatched connectors can cause frustrating compatibility issues or require adapters.

- **XT60**:
  - **Amperage Rating**: Up to 60A.
  - **Why It’s Popular**: Reliable, compact, and beginner-friendly. Perfect for most 1/10 scale trucks running 2S or 3S LiPos.
  - **Use Case**: Your **HOBBYWING EZRUN MAX10 G2** already uses an XT60 connector, so pairing it with an XT60-equipped battery ensures easy plug-and-play compatibility.

- **Deans (T-Plug)**:
  - **Amperage Rating**: Up to 60A.
  - **Why It’s Popular**: A classic connector, widely used but slightly less robust than XT60.
  - **Use Case**: Often found in older setups or budget batteries.

- **EC3/EC5**:
  - **Amperage Rating**: EC3 (~60A), EC5 (~120A).
  - **Why It’s Popular**: Designed by Horizon Hobby and common with Spektrum products.
  - **Use Case**: Higher current systems, especially if you’re using Spektrum batteries and ESCs.

- **Traxxas Connector**:
  - **Amperage Rating**: Varies by model, often up to 100A.
  - **Why It’s Popular**: Proprietary connector used by Traxxas vehicles.
  - **Use Case**: If you’re using Traxxas products, these connectors are standard.

### ESC to Motor Connectors

For brushless motors, these connectors transmit power between the ESC and motor:

- **Bullet Connectors**:
  - Standard sizes: **3.5mm** and **4mm**.
  - **Why It’s Popular**: Secure and easy to connect/disconnect.
  - **Use Case**: Pre-soldered bullet connectors are often included on motors and ESCs. Make sure both sides match.

### Accessory Connectors

These connectors power accessories like lights or fans:

- **JST (Red)**:
  - Low-current connector, commonly used for powering small components.
  - Compact and lightweight.
- **XT30**:
  - A smaller version of the XT60, designed for higher-current accessories.

## Choosing the Right Connectors

To avoid the hassle of soldering or using adapters, choose components that use the same connector type. Since your ESC and charger both use **XT60**, look for batteries with XT60 connectors to keep things simple.
