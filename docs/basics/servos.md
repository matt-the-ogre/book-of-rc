# Servos

A **servo** is the key component that controls precise movements in your RC vehicle, such as steering. While small and often overlooked, a high-quality servo can dramatically improve your vehicle’s performance and handling. Let’s dive into how servos work, their specifications, and how to choose the right one for your off-road truck.

## How Servos Work

A servo receives signals from the receiver and uses its internal motor to adjust the position of its output arm. This movement is highly precise, allowing for smooth and accurate control of your RC vehicle's steering or other functions.

### Key Components

1. **Motor**: Provides the rotational force.
2. **Gears**: Transfer power from the motor to the output arm.
     - Metal gears are stronger and more durable.
     - Plastic gears are lighter but less resistant to wear.
3. **Case**: Protects the internal components. A waterproof case is crucial for off-road use.

## Key Specifications

### Torque

- Measured in kg.cm or oz.in, torque determines the turning power of the servo.
- For a 1/10 scale off-road truck, aim for at least **15 kg.cm** of torque to handle rough terrain and large tires.

### Speed

- Measured in seconds per 60° of rotation (e.g., 0.16 sec/60°).
- Faster servos improve responsiveness, but for off-road trucks, prioritize torque over speed.

### Power Supply

- Most servos operate on **5V-7.4V**, provided by the ESC’s built-in BEC (Battery Elimination Circuit).
- Higher voltages (e.g., 7.4V) often improve performance in high-torque servos.

### Waterproofing

- Essential for off-road driving, ensuring the servo can handle mud, water, and debris.

## Matching Your Servo

The right servo depends on your vehicle’s size and intended use:

- **Steering Servo**: Choose a high-torque servo for reliable control over rough terrain.
- **Additional Functions**: If your truck has features like locking differentials or a winch, you may need extra servos.

## Good, Better, Best Recommendations

### Good: Power HD 20kg 1501MG

- **Torque**: 20 kg.cm at 6V.
- **Speed**: 0.16 sec/60° at 6V.
- **Why Choose This**: Affordable and reliable with metal gears, making it a great entry-level option.

### Better: Savox SC-0251MG

- **Torque**: 16 kg.cm at 6V.
- **Speed**: 0.18 sec/60° at 6V.
- **Why Choose This**: Durable and precise, ideal for off-road use with a balance of speed and torque.

### Best: Reefs RC 422HD V2

- **Torque**: 25 kg.cm at 7.4V.
- **Speed**: 0.12 sec/60° at 7.4V.
- **Why Choose This**: Fully waterproof with high torque and speed for the most demanding off-road conditions.

## Final Thoughts

The right servo can make your RC truck feel smooth, responsive, and capable of handling even the toughest terrain. For a balance of performance and value, start with a servo like the Power HD 20kg, and upgrade to a high-performance option like the Reefs RC 422HD V2 as you push your truck to new limits.
