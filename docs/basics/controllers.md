# Controllers (Transmitters and Receivers)

The **controller** is your direct connection to your RC vehicle. It’s how you steer, accelerate, brake, and manage any extra features like lights or winches. Controllers typically consist of two parts: the **transmitter** (what you hold in your hand) and the **receiver** (installed in the vehicle). Together, they ensure your commands are sent and executed seamlessly. Let’s break it down.

## How Controllers Work

1. **Transmitter (TX)**:
     - This is the handheld device with joysticks, wheels, or triggers that you use to control the vehicle.
     - It sends signals to the receiver over a **2.4GHz frequency**, which is standard for modern RC systems because it reduces interference and improves range.

2. **Receiver (RX)**:
    - Installed in your vehicle, the receiver interprets the signals from the transmitter and passes them to the appropriate components (e.g., ESC, servo, lights).
    - It typically connects to the ESC, steering servo, and any additional channels for accessories.

## Key Specifications

When selecting a controller, consider the following:

1. **Number of Channels**:
    - Each **channel** controls one function. For a basic truck, you need at least:
       - **Channel 1**: Steering.
       - **Channel 2**: Throttle/brake.
    - Additional channels (3-6) are useful for controlling features like lights, gear shifts, or winches.
2. **Range**:
    - Most 2.4GHz transmitters have a range of about 300-500m, more than enough for off-road or backyard driving.
3. **Telemetry (Optional)**:
    - Higher-end systems can send real-time data (e.g., battery voltage, motor temperature) back to the transmitter.
4. **Ergonomics**:
    - Comfort matters, especially for long sessions. Look for a well-balanced transmitter with easy-to-reach controls.
5. **Model Memory**:
    - If you plan to own multiple RC vehicles, look for a transmitter with **model memory** to store settings for each vehicle.

## Types of Transmitters

1. **Pistol-Grip**: Common for surface RC vehicles. Features a trigger for throttle/brake and a wheel for steering.
2. **Stick-Style**: Used more often in planes, boats, or legacy vehicles but still functional for cars.

> What I bought: I got a pistol-grip transmitter for my build. It has three channels. It's the FlySky model FS-GT3B identified below as the "Good" recommendation.
